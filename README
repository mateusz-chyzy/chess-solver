The main purpose of this application is to tell whether it is possible to make one move to win or tie.
For this solution I have used patterns:
Factory - to create pieces on the board
Builder - builds the chessboard with updated moves. Builder also uses immutable data.
Facade - a simpler interface for all chess operations.
Strategy - logic for pawns
